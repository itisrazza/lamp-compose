# LAMP Compose

A repo template for a standard LAMP server setup with Docker. Includes phpMyAdmin for database management.

This template is meant for quick and dirty experiments requiring the LAMP stack. For something more production ready, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

## Get Started

Clone the Git repo and run `docker compose up`.

The Apache server is exported on port `8080` and phpMyAdmin is exported to port `8081`.

## MariaDB Password

The root password is `password`.

## Licence

Go ahead copy it, steal it, do whatever with it. If this brings any value to you, maybe consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/itisrazza)?
